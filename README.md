# Sinatra Sublime

A Sublime Text package, for the [Sinatra ruby web framework](http://sinatrarb.com/). It currently on has snippets, but I'll extend workspaces and other extensions sooner or later.
<br><br>

## Usage

`get + <TAB>` will give you:
<br>
```
get '/' do

end
```
<br><br>
This is the same thing for `put`, `post`,`patch` and `delete`.

## Installation

```
$ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages
$ git clone http://github.com/karlcoelho/Sinatra-Sublime.git Sinatra
```
<br><br>
Then just restart Sublime, and you're ready!

## Warnings

I've only tested this on Sublime Text 2. ST 3 should work exactly the same, but I'm not sure.
<br>
If you do see problems, feel free to [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/therealcoelho) about the problem.
